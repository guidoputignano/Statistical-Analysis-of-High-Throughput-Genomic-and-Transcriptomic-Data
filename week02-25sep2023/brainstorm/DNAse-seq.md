# DNAse-seq
DNase-seq, short for DNase I hypersensitive sites sequencing, is a method used to identify regions of the genome (DNAse hypersensitivity sites, DHS) that are accessible to the protein DNase I. These accessible regions often correspond to regulatory elements, such as promoters, enhancers, and insulators, which play crucial roles in gene expression. By sequencing the DNA fragments that are cleaved by DNase I, researchers can create a genome-wide map of these regulatory elements, providing insights into the regulatory landscape of a cell.

| Technology | Application | Statistics |
| ---------- | ----------- | ---------- |
| DNAse-seq | Map chromatin state, map regulatory elements, create regulatory networks, Motif Enrichment Analysis | Monte-Carlo methods|
| | Differential Accessibility Analysis | non-parametric statistical tests like Wilcoxon rank-sum test, DESeq2, edgeR |
| | Gene regulation and chromatin dynamics | Hidden Markov Models, Baysian Mixture Models, Sliding Window, Logistic regression|

**Differential Accessibility Analysis**: For experiments comparing different conditions or cell types, statistical methods are used to identify regions with differential chromatin accessibility.

**Motif Enrichment Analysis**: Once DHSs are identified, motif analysis can be performed to predict which transcription factors might be binding to these regions.
