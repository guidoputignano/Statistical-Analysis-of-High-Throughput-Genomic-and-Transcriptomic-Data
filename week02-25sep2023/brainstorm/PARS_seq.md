# PARS-Seq

- **PARS** or **P**arallel **A**nalysis of **R**NA **S**tructure is a method to elucidate the secondary RNA structure of the whole genome by linking the digestion pattern of ds/ss-specific RNAses with high-throughput sequencing of cDNA [1, 2]. 
- The output reads of the high-thoughput sequencing are merged into a so-called PARS score (log of number of reads sliced by the ds-specific RNAse V1 divided by number of reads by the ss-specific RNAse S1) which can be introduced into SeqFold (structure prediction program) [3] to predict precise secondary RNA structures. 
- The main statistical analysis of this method relies on hypergeometric tests and structure sampling from Boltzmann-weighted ensemble performed in **SeqFold** [3].
