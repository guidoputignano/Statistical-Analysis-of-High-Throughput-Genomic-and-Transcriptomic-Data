# Statistical Analysis of High-Throughput Genomic and Transcriptomic Data
 

 
# Course Review
- **Instructor**: Mark Robbinson
- **Institution**: ETH Zurich
- **Year**: 2023

## General Consideration

I took the course with Mark Robbinson at ETH Zurich in 2023. Here are some general considerations:

- The course is mostly self-paced.
- The professors tend to describe the topics broadly and superficially.
- The purpose of the course is to introduce libraries that can be used rather than providing a deep understanding of the subject.
- There is typically one new topic introduced each week.

## Time Commitment

In terms of time commitment:

- It may require approximately one day per week to solve all the problems and get the solutions.
- Despite the workload, it seems that almost everyone manages to achieve the maximum score.

## Grading Perspective

From a grading perspective:

- Only two people received the maximum score of 6 at the end.
- At UZH, there are 0.5 differences in grading.
- It's likely to receive a score of 5 or 5.5, even with a significant amount of work.
